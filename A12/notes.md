Recursive Functions:
Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of the problem.  
In sum(n), the function keeps calling itself with n-1 until n == 0 (base case).
The star pattern is printed by printing one line and calling the function with n-1.
The Fibonacci function calls itself twice: fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) until n <= 1.
